## Security & Privacy

- **Microphone Permissions**: Requests user permission before accessing microphone

- **Matrix Encryption**: Integrates with Matrix's end-to-end encryption when available

## Testing the System

1. **Demo Call**: Use the "Demo Call" button to test without real contacts
2. **Multiple Browsers**: Open multiple browser tabs to test call simulation
3. **Microphone**: Ensure microphone permissions are granted
4. **Audio Output**: Test with headphones to avoid audio feedback

The Matrix call system is now fully integrated and ready for use! Users can click the phone icon in the header to start making voice calls through the Matrix protocol.
