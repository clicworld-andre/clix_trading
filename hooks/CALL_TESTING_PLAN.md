- Counter updates every second
- Time remains accurate throughout call

#### Test 3.2: Duration in Call History
**Objective**: Test duration recording in call history

**Steps**:

2. End the call
3. Check call history for accurate duration

**Expected Results**:
- Call history shows correct duration
- Duration matches actual call time
- History persists after page refresh

### 4. **WebRTC Integration Tests**

#### Test 4.1: Audio Stream Initialization

VoiceCall: Created peer connection with configuration
VoiceCall: WebRTC peer connection initialized for production call
```

#### Test 4.2: ICE Candidate Handling
**Objective**: Test ICE candidate generation and handling

**Steps**:
1. Establish call connection
2. Monitor console for ICE candidate logs
3. Check connection state changes

**Expected Results**:
- ICE candidates are generated and logged
- Connection states progress properly
- No critical ICE errors (warnings are acceptable)

**Console Logs to Monitor**:
```
VoiceCall: New ICE candidate: [candidate_info]
VoiceCall: ICE gathering state: [state]
VoiceCall: Connection state: [state]
```

#### Test 4.3: Audio Controls
**Objective**: Test mute/unmute and speaker controls

**Steps**:
1. During active call, test mute button
2. Test speaker on/off button
3. Verify visual feedback and functionality

**Expected Results**:
- Mute button toggles microphone (visual indicator changes)
- Speaker button controls audio output
- Toast notifications for each action
- Controls disabled during non-connected states

### 5. **Call History Tests**

#### Test 5.1: Automatic Call Recording

1. Use two different browsers/devices
2. Make calls between them
3. Verify events are properly sent and received

**Expected Results**:
- Call invite events properly transmitted
- Answer/hangup events synchronized
- Call states match on both clients

#### Test 7.2: UI State Consistency
**Objective**: Test UI updates match call state

**Steps**:

## üß™ Quick Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Complete Call Flow (5 minutes)
1. Start call ‚Üí Wait for answer ‚Üí Talk for 1 minute ‚Üí End call
2. Check: Duration tracking, history recording, proper cleanup

### Scenario B: Missed Call Flow (1 minute)
1. Have someone call you ‚Üí Don't answer ‚Üí Wait for timeout
2. Check: Timeout handling, missed call in history

### Scenario C: Failed Call Flow (2 minutes)
1. Call non-existent user or deny microphone permission
2. Check: Error handling, failed call in history

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Console Commands for Testing
```javascript
// Check call state
useMatrixCalls().callState

// Check call history
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('call-history') || '[]')

// Clear call history
localStorage.removeItem('call-history')

// Simulate incoming call (for testing)
useMatrixCalls().simulateIncomingCall('test-room', '@test:user.com', 'Test User')
```

### Key Console Log Filters
- `CallContext:` - All call context operations
- `VoiceCall:` - WebRTC and UI operations
- `m.call` - Matrix call events

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Must Pass:
- [ ] All call states transition correctly
- [ ] Timeouts work as specified (30s/60s)
- [ ] Duration tracking is accurate
- [ ] Call history records all calls
- [ ] WebRTC initializes without errors
- [ ] Audio controls function properly
- [ ] Error handling prevents crashes

### Should Pass:
- [ ] ICE candidates generate successfully

## üö® Critical Issues to Watch For

1. **Call State Stuck**: Call UI doesn't close after call ends
2. **Duration Drift**: Duration counter becomes inaccurate over time
3. **Memory Leaks**: WebRTC connections not properly cleaned up
4. **Event Loops**: Multiple event listeners causing duplicate calls
5. **Storage Bloat**: Call history growing indefinitely
6. **Permission Loops**: Repeated microphone permission requests
